Each lab exercise should be complemented with a series of steps, similar to the detailed installation and setup guide, to ensure students can perform tasks independently. The duration is an estimate; it may vary depending on the complexity of the topic and the students' proficiency. The exercises can be adapted to either individual or group work, with checkpoints for instructors to assess understanding and provide feedback.

For the exercises to be effective, they should be accompanied by detailed documentation, examples, and troubleshooting guides to facilitate a smooth learning experience. Regular updates and maintenance checks are essential to keep the lab environment conducive to learning.
