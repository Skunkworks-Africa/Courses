Manual Styling Reference
This section of the course manual outlines the styling conventions adopted to ensure clarity, consistency, and a visually engaging learning experience. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining the professional appearance and readability of the course content.
Font Choices:
•	Body Text: Verdana, 11 pt - Chosen for its high readability on both screens and printed material.
•	Headings: Arial Bold, 14 pt for main headings (H1), 12 pt for subheadings (H2), and 11 pt bold for tertiary headings (H3) - This sans-serif font provides clear delineation of sections and sub-sections.
•	Code Snippets: Consolas or Courier New, 10 pt - These monospaced fonts ensure that code is easily distinguishable from explanatory text and properly aligned.
Color Scheme:
•	Primary Text: Black (#000000) - For maximum contrast and legibility.
•	Headings: Skunkworks Blue (#003366) - To align with the corporate identity and for clear section differentiation.
•	Highlights/Emphasis: Skunkworks Orange (#FF6600) - Used sparingly to draw attention to key concepts or important notes.
Page Layout:
•	Margins: 1-inch margins on all sides to allow for comfortable reading and note-taking.
•	Alignment: Left-aligned text with a ragged right edge to prevent uneven spacing between words.
•	Line Spacing: 1.5 lines to enhance readability and provide space for annotations.
Paragraph Styling:
•	Indentation: No indentation for the first line of paragraphs; block style is used to maintain a clean and modern layout.
•	Spacing: A single space after periods and a blank line between paragraphs to visually separate ideas.
Bullets and Numbering:
•	Use bullets for lists of items or features.
•	Use numbering for steps, instructions, or items that require a specific order.
Tables and Figures:
•	Borders: Minimalist borders (1 pt) to avoid cluttering the page.
•	Headings: Bold with background color matching the Skunkworks Blue to maintain brand consistency.
•	Captions: Placed below tables and figures, italicized for distinction.
Hyperlinks:
•	Underlined and colored in Skunkworks Blue to stand out from the body text and indicate interactivity.
Accessibility:
•	Alt text provided for all images and figures for screen reader compatibility.
•	High-contrast color palette to accommodate users with visual impairments.
Printing Considerations:
•	Designed for printing in both color and grayscale without loss of clarity or quality.
•	Ensure that hyperlinks are useful even in printed format by providing descriptive link text or a URL list in the annexure.
Consistency Check:
•	Before finalizing the manual, a thorough review will be conducted to ensure that these styling guidelines have been consistently applied throughout the document.
By following these styling references, we aim to deliver a manual that is not only informative but also a pleasure to read and use. Should there be any updates or changes to these guidelines, they will be communicated and reflected in subsequent versions of this manual.

Introduction
Welcome Message
Welcome to "Secure Coding Best Practices with OWASP Top 10," a course designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to write secure code and understand the most common web application security vulnerabilities. As we embark on this journey together, our goal is to foster an environment of active learning, critical thinking, and practical application. We are thrilled to have you with us and are confident that the insights and skills you gain here will be invaluable in your professional development.
About This Manual
This manual serves as your roadmap through the course, providing detailed outlines, resources, and guidance to support your learning experience. It is structured to align with our educational philosophy, integrating Bloom's Taxonomy, Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Assessment for Learning (AfL) to create a dynamic, interactive, and impactful learning journey.
Course Design Framework
Our course is meticulously designed to not only impart knowledge but also to develop your ability to apply, analyze, and create secure coding practices. The course framework is built upon three pillars:
1.	Cognitive Development: Ensuring that you not only learn but also understand and can apply the concepts of secure coding.
2.	Problem-Solving: Engaging you with real-world security challenges to develop your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
3.	Continuous Assessment: Providing ongoing feedback to facilitate your learning and retention of course material.
Integration of Bloom's Taxonomy
Bloom's Taxonomy is integrated into our course to scaffold your learning experience from foundational knowledge to advanced application:
•	Remembering: We begin by introducing the core concepts of secure coding and the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
•	Understanding: You will then explore the reasoning behind each vulnerability and its potential impact.
•	Applying: Through hands-on exercises, you will apply your knowledge to identify vulnerabilities in code.
•	Analyzing: As the course progresses, you will analyze code for complex security issues and understand their root causes.
•	Evaluating: You will learn to evaluate coding practices for security risks and propose mitigations.
•	Creating: Finally, you will create secure code snippets and develop strategies for integrating security into the development lifecycle.
Implementation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
PBL is at the heart of our course structure. Each module presents a problem that mirrors a real-world scenario, challenging you to:
•	Engage with the problem by understanding its context and constraints.
•	Research the underlying principles and existing solutions.
•	Collaborate with peers to discuss and debate approaches.
•	Develop practical solutions and strategies for secure coding.
•	Reflect on the learning process and the solutions developed.
Strategy for Assessment for Learning (AfL)
Our AfL approach ensures that assessments are not merely checkpoints but integral parts of the learning process:
•	Formative Assessments: Regular quizzes and exercises provide immediate feedback, helping you gauge your understanding and instructors to tailor teaching accordingly.
•	Summative Assessments: End-of-module assessments encapsulate your learning and provide a comprehensive review of your skills.
•	Peer Assessment: Engaging in peer reviews to foster a community of learning and provide diverse perspectives on problem-solving.
•	Self-Assessment: Encouraging self-reflection to identify areas of strength and opportunities for growth.

Safe Work Methods and Solutions
Topic 1: Taint Analysis
•	Safe Work Method: Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools
•	Solution: Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools that offer taint analysis features. These tools can automatically trace the flow of tainted data across the codebase.
•	Safe Work Method: Code Annotations
•	Solution: Use code annotations to mark trusted and untrusted data sources. This makes it easier to perform manual taint analysis during code reviews.
Topic 2: Cloud Secrets Detection
•	Safe Work Method: Secrets Management Systems
•	Solution: Use a centralized secrets management system like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to store, manage, and retrieve secrets securely.
•	Safe Work Method: Environment Variables
•	Solution: Store secrets in environment variables instead of hardcoding them into the application. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it easier to manage secrets.
Topic 3: Buffer Overflows
•	Safe Work Method: Bounds Checking
•	Solution: Always perform bounds checking before writing data to a buffer. This can prevent buffer overflows by ensuring that the data fits within the allocated buffer.
•	Safe Work Method: Safe Libraries
•	Solution: Use libraries that are designed to handle buffer operations securely. For example, in C/C++, prefer using functions like strncpy() over strcpy().
